# 🔹 C++ Pointers Practice

This repository contains a single C++ file (`practice.cpp`) that covers **pointers in C++** with detailed comments and examples for learning purposes.

---

## 📂 File

- **practice.cpp**  
  Includes code and explanations for:

  - ✅ **Pointer basics**  
    Covers assignment, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic.

  - ✅ **Pointers with arrays**  
    Shows how arrays and pointers are related, printing addresses and values using pointers.

  - ✅ **Comparison between char arrays and int arrays**  
    Explains how character arrays behave differently (strings) compared to integer arrays when used with pointers.

  - ✅ **Dynamic memory allocation (1D and 2D arrays)**  
    Demonstrates how to allocate and free memory dynamically using `new` and `delete`.

  - ✅ **Function pointers**  
    Shows how pointers can be used to pass variables by reference to functions (`swap`, `sum`, `multiply`).

  - ✅ **Pointer-to-pointer (double pointers)**  
    Explains how to use pointers that point to other pointers, and how they work with arrays.

  - ✅ **Character pointer arrays and integer pointer arrays**  
    Classic examples of using arrays of pointers to store strings and integers.

  - ✅ **Pointers with 2D arrays**  
    Demonstrates pointer-based access to 2D arrays, including dereferencing in nested loops.

  - ✅ **Dynamic 2D int arrays**  
    Shows how to dynamically allocate and free a 2D array of integers using pointers.

## ⚡ How to Run

1. Download `practice.cpp`.  
2. Compile it using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++):  

   ```bash
   g++ practice.cpp -o practice
   ./practice
Since the file has multiple independent code blocks,

Uncomment the section you want to test

Recompile and run again

📝 Notes
This file is meant purely for practice and learning, not production code.

It covers both fundamental and advanced concepts of pointers in C++.

Code is commented for easy understanding.

📘 This repository is intended as a learning reference for anyone exploring C++ pointers.
