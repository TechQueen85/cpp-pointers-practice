## ⚡ How to Run

1. Download `practice.cpp`.  
2. Compile it using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++):  

   ```bash
   g++ practice.cpp -o practice
   ./practice
Since the file has multiple independent code blocks,

Uncomment the section you want to test

Recompile and run again

📝 Notes
This file is meant purely for practice and learning, not production code.

It covers almost all the fundamental and advanced concepts of pointers in C++.

Code is heavily commented for easy understanding.
